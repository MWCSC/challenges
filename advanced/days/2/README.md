# Day 2 - Larger Data Sizes

### Welcome to Day 2!

Hello and welcome to day 2. As part of the CISS, last challenge, you recovered a top secret keypad access code from a piece of paper. 

Using your help, we were able to crack the keypad and gain access past the secured door. However, we were immediately greeted by hundreds of armed robots, who had been set off by a secret alarm.

Our agents were able to retreat, but not before one of them lost a sizable chunk of his hand. These robots are undefeatable in their large numbers, unless we are able to defeat them as a whole.

The intelligence team has found a pattern in their behaviour, as reported by our agents. This pattern points to a vulnerability in their shielded body. If we can find the correct pattern in each robot, we can take down the entire fleet.

### Mission

In each line of input, find the letter 'h'. Note its position in the file, and the NUMBER that falls after it. Print out the SUM of all the positions of the letter age, MULTIPLIED by the PRODUCT of all the numbers that fall AFTER the letter 'h'.

### Mission Resources

- [Print Function](https://github.com/mwcsc/documentation/blob/master/python/01-print-function.md)
- [For Loop](https://github.com/mwcsc/documentation/blob/master/python/05-for-loop.md)
- [File Manipulation](https://github.com/mwcsc/documentation/blob/master/python/13-file-manipulation.md)

### Information:

- You MUST import the input file to access the input, do not copy the input into your program directly
- The number you are looking for is found by adding all the positions of the letter 'h' in every line, multiplied by the product of each number after the letter 'h' in each line  
- There is only one h per line
- There is only one number per line

### Values:

See the ``input.txt`` file.

### Expected output format:

- Integer Value
- No units or words, just the number
- No trailing newlines

Example:

```12345```
